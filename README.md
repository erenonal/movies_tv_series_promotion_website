# IMDB Movies and TV Series Project

## Project Overview
- This project utilizes Vue 3 to display movie content fetched from The Movie Database (TMDb) API on a website. Access the website [here](https://vitalencase.netlify.app).

## API Integration
- Axios is used to make requests to the TMDb API, incorporating API tokens, headers, and parameters for authentication and data retrieval.

## Routing
- Vue Router library is implemented for routing within the website.

## Styling
- The project employs plain CSS for styling, avoiding the use of pre-built frameworks or libraries.

## Responsiveness
- The website is designed to be responsive, with a focus on the commonly accepted 768px breakpoint for mobile devices.

## Error Handling
- Error handling mechanisms are implemented throughout the project to ensure smooth user experience.

## Pagination
- Pagination functionality is included to ensure that each page displays at least 8 movies or TV shows. Additional pages are requested if necessary.

## Detailed Content
- Detailed content is fetched only when a card is clicked, using the card's ID to make targeted requests.

## Color Scheme
- Colors are extracted from a Figma design file and stored as an array in a JavaScript file, facilitating easy implementation of color changes based on specific keywords.
